//! Phase 1A.3 — Replacement Effect Framework
//!
//! Replacement effects modify or replace game events as they happen (CR 614).
//! When multiple replacement effects could apply to the same event, the affected
//! player (or controller of the affected object) chooses the order in which they
//! apply. This ordering decision is surfaced as `Action::ChooseReplacementOrder`
//! so MCCFR can observe and optimize it.
//!
//! # Design Constraints
//!
//! - Replacement effects are checked *before* an event happens, not after
//! - Each replacement effect can only apply once to a given event (CR 614.5)
//! - Self-replacement effects (e.g., "enters tapped") are applied first without
//!   player choice (CR 614.16a)
//! - The ordering decision only arises when multiple non-self replacement effects
//!   could apply
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! - "If a creature would die, exile it instead" (Rest in Peace)
//! - "If you would draw a card, instead draw two and put one back" (Sylvan Library)
//! - "If damage would be dealt to you, prevent 1 of it" (damage prevention)
//! - "This creature enters the battlefield tapped" (self-replacement)
