//! Phase 1A.2 — Event System Skeleton
//!
//! Game events are transient notifications that fire during `apply_action()`
//! and `resolve_effect()`. They are NOT part of `GameState` and do NOT affect
//! `Clone`/snapshot cost. This preserves the cheap-clone invariant required
//! by MCCFR traversal.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Events flow through an `EventBus` that holds a function-pointer table
//! (not per-game-state dynamic dispatch). Handlers receive
//! `(&mut GameState, &GameEvent)` and can inspect or mutate state in
//! response to events.
//!
//! The event bus is intentionally kept outside `GameState`:
//! - It is not cloned when `GameState::clone()` is called
//! - It is not serialized
//! - It is reconstructed/configured at the engine level, not per game
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let mut bus = EventBus::new();
//! bus.subscribe(|state, event| {
//!     if let GameEvent::ZoneChange { .. } = event {
//!         // react to zone changes
//!     }
//! });
//! bus.emit(&mut state, &GameEvent::DamageDealt { ... });
//! ```
